# Servy

This codebase is the result of following along with the pragmatic studio course "Developing with Elixir/OTP".  I've been through the course previously, but that was back in 2018 and thought that a refresher was in order.


## Copyright.

The copyright to the code is owned by Pragamatic Studio.

Whilst I technically typed the code, I did so following along with the video tutorials. In copyright terms it is considered to be a derivate work. I make no assertion on the copyright and I've made my derivate work public to demonstrate that I've completed the course.

If there are any issues with this being public drop me an email [me@treejamie.com][0] and we can talk about it.
